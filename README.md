# ChatGPT-Style multimodal Ultrasound Diagnostic Model for Thyroid Nodules: A Retrospective, Multicentre, Diagnostic Study

*Abstract*

Background: Non-invasive and accurate risk assessment of thyroid nodules is crucial for the early diagnosis and of thyroid malignancies. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on ultrasound images offer a promising approach, but traditional AI models lack transparency and interpretability, leading to a lack of trust in AI diagnostic results among radiologists. Therefore, we developed a multimodal ChatGPT-style model called ThyGPT, aimed at providing an interactive and interpretable approach for accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules.

*Methods:*

We collected 634,796 ultrasound images and 53,721 reports from 75,133 patients across 9 hospitals. One training set and two test sets were established. Test set 1 evaluated ThyGPT's capability in assisting risk assessment and reducing unnecessary biopsies, while test set 2 assessed its performance in detecting report errors. We compared the diagnostic performance of 6 radiologists, with and without ThyGPT assistance.

*Findings:* 

On test set 1 (3,605 nodules, 1,612 malignancies), radiologists achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.801 (95% CI: 0.796, 0.807). However, with the assistance of ThyGPT, their mean AUC improved to 0.919 (95% CI: 0.916, 0.923; p<0.001). Moreover, ThyGPT facilitated reducing unnecessary biopsies, as the biopsy rate decreased from 63.1% to 21.7% (p<0.001) without increasing the missed diagnosis rate. On test set 2 (1,351 reports, 157 erroneous), ThyGPT demonstrated an error detection rate of 0.911 (143/157; 95% CI: 0.904, 0.917). With the assistance of ThyGPT, radiologists increased their average error detection rate from 0.764 (120/157; 95% CI: 0.751, 0.779) to 0.968 (152/157; 95% CI: 0.963, 0.974; p<0.001).

*Interpretation:*

As an AI-generated content enhanced computer-aided diagnosis (AIGC-CAD) model, ThyGPT can intelligently interact with radiologists, automate risk assessment processes, provide decision support, and detect potential errors in diagnostic reports. Models resembling ThyGPT may represent the mainstream direction fo
